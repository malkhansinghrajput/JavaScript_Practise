ES5 Syntax:not supported classes, function constructor.
In JavaScript ES5, a function constructor serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It is a regular function, but it is invoked using the new keyword. By convention, function constructors are named with a capital first letter to distinguish them from regular functions.

<script>
   var Mobile = function(model_no) {
      this.model_no = model_no
      this.price = 5000;
   }

   //new : It is a keyword which is used to allocate memory
   var vivo = new Mobile("Vivo")
   var oppo = new Mobile("Oppo")
   oppo.color = "white"
   vivo.color = "white"
   console.log(vivo)
   console.log(oppo)
