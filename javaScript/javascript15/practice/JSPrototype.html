<!--
In javaScript, a prototype is a machanism that allow object(Function, Array, JSobject, String) to inherit properties and method from other objects. Each javaScript Object has an internal property, which points to another object. This prototype chain allows properties and methods to be shared across objects.
=====
How Prototype work :
When we create a new object using new Person(), it inherit properties  from person constructor function's prototype .
The method greet is not directly inside the persion1 object , but JavaScript will look in the prototype chain and find it in persion. ProtoType.
========
ProtoType Chain :
Persion 1 will First look for the method greet in its own properties.
If it doesn't find it there , it will search in Persion.Prototype.
If Persion.Prototype does not have  the method,
JavaScript will continue looking further up the  
prototype chain (e.g, prototype).
this : it is a reference to current object

<script>
    // Constructor Function
    function person(name,age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    // Adding a method to the prototype of person
    person.prototype.greet = function(){
        console.log(`Hello, My Name Is ${this.name} & I am ${this.age} Year Old. `)
    }

    // Creating an instance of person
    let person1 = new person("malkhan Singh",24);
    let person2 = new person("Rahul Sharma",34);
   var m = person1.__proto__.address="USA"

    // Calling the Greet method 
    person1.greet();  
    person2.greet()
    // Output : Hello , my name is Alice and I am 24 year old

    console.log(person1)
    console.log(person2)
    console.log(m)
