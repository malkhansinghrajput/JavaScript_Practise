ES5 Syntax : not support classes, function constructor
In JavaScript ES5, a function constructor serves as a blueprint for creating object. It is a regular function, but it is invoked using the new keyword. By convention, function constructors are named with a capital first letter to distinguish them from regular function.

<script>
    var Mobile = function (model_no) {
        this.model_no=model_no;
        this.price= 5000;
    }

    // new : it is a keyword Which is used to allocate memory
    var vivo = new Mobile("Vivo")
    var oppo = new Mobile("Oppo")
    oppo.color = "White"
    vivo.color = "White"
    console.log(vivo)
    console.log(oppo)
