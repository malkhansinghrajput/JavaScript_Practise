<!-- 
Temporal Dead Zone: 
In JavaScript, the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a period between a variable's declaration (using let or const) and its initialization, where accessing the variable results in a ReferenceError.
The TDZ is a concept introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) related to variables declared with let and const.
When it occurs: The TDZ starts at the beginning of a block scope and ends when the variable is initialized. 
Why it matters: Trying to access a variable within its TDZ will cause a ReferenceError

<script>

  console.log(myVar); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myVar' before initialization
  console.log("Hello")
  console.log("World")
  const myVar = 10;
  console.log(myVar); // 10

</script>
